# Authoring a tinyflows workflow

This is a **reference manual, not a procedure**. It holds the exact rules that
are too long to keep in a system prompt and too precise to reconstruct from
memory: an expression convention you half-remember produces a graph that
validates and then does the wrong thing at run time.

Read the one page that covers what you are about to configure.

| page | read it before you |
| --- | --- |
| `references/expressions.md` | write any `=` expression or jq filter, or attach a produced file to an outbound action |
| `references/node-config.md` | configure a `memory`, `dedup` or `trigger` node, or set per-node error handling |
| `references/dry-run.md` | report what a dry run did and did not prove |

Fetch one with:

```
read_workflow_resource { skill_id: "flow-authoring", relative_path: "references/expressions.md" }
```

## What is deliberately not here

**Per-kind configuration.** `get_node_kind_contract { kind }` returns a node
kind's config fields, ports, a worked example and its gotchas, and it is
generated from the same catalog the validator enforces — so it cannot go stale
the way this text can. Where the two disagree, the contract tool is right.
These pages cover the rules that span kinds, which is why they have nowhere
generated to live.

**The rules you must not break.** Propose rather than persist, ask before a
real run, ground every slug, prefer the minimal viable graph — those stay in
the system prompt, because a rule that only binds once someone chooses to read
it is not a rule. Graph sizing was moved here during an earlier pass and moved
back for exactly that reason: it shapes every graph, including the ones built
without opening a manual.
